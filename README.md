Code for the Raspberry Pi in Python

lightTest.py is a functional script to test the LEDs on device0

MQTT_Lights.py is the full code that I have implemented on the Raspberry Pi that is in control of the lights

MQTT_Periodic_Test.py is a script that cycles through the commands of MQTT_Lights.py in order to stress test the configuration

MQTT_GUI.py is the code on the touch screen Pi in order to control the lights across the network
